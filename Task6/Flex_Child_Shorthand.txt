short note on the flex child shorthand property in CSS:

📦 CSS flex Shorthand (Flex Child)
The flex shorthand is used on flex items (children) to set how they grow, shrink, and their base size.

🔧 Syntax:
css
Copy
Edit
flex: [flex-grow] [flex-shrink] [flex-basis];
🧱 Components:
flex-grow: how much the item can grow (1 = can grow, 0 = no grow)

flex-shrink: how much the item can shrink (1 = can shrink)

flex-basis: initial size before growing/shrinking (auto, 0, 100px, etc.)

📝 Examples:
css
Copy
Edit
flex: 1;              /* = 1 1 0%, can grow and shrink equally */
flex: 0 1 auto;       /* default: no grow, shrink if needed */
flex: 2 0 100px;      /* grow twice as fast, no shrink, base size 100px */
