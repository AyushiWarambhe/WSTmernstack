short note on the outline property in CSS:

✏️ CSS outline Property (Short Note)
The outline property draws a line around an element, outside the border. It is used mainly for focus indicators and accessibility.

🔧 Syntax:
css
Copy
Edit
outline: [color] [style] [width];
🧱 Components:
outline-color: line color (red, #000, transparent)

outline-style: line style (solid, dashed, none, etc.)

outline-width: line thickness (1px, thin, etc.)

📝 Example:
css
Copy
Edit
outline: 2px solid blue;
This sets a blue solid outline 2px thick.

🧠 Notes:
Unlike borders, outlines don’t take up space (they don’t affect layout).

You can remove outlines with:

css
Copy
Edit
outline: none;
(But avoid this unless replacing with another visible focus style.)
