RESTful API (Representational State Transfer)
A RESTful API is a way for two systems (like client and server) to talk to each other over the internet using rules called REST. It is mostly used in web apps to send and receive data.

Key Principles

Client-Server → Frontend and backend work independently.
Stateless → Server doesn’t remember previous requests; each request must have all required details.
Uniform Interface → Resources are accessed in a standard way using URLs and HTTP methods.
Resource-Based → Everything is considered a "resource" (like users, products) with a unique URL.
Representation → Data can be sent in formats like JSON (most common) or XML.
Cacheable → Responses can be saved to speed up future requests.

Common HTTP Methods

GET → Fetch data (read).
POST → Add new data.
PUT → Update whole data.
PATCH → Update part of data.
DELETE → Remove data.

Example:

GET /users → Get all users
GET /users/1 → Get user with ID 1
POST /users → Add a new user
PUT /users/1 → Update user with ID 1
DELETE /users/1 → Delete user with ID 1
