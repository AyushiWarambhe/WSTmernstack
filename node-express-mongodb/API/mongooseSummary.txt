What is Mongoose?

Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
It lets you interact with MongoDB using JavaScript objects instead of writing raw queries.
Mainly used in the backend (Express + Node) part.

Why use Mongoose?

Schema-based modeling → You can define a structure (schema) for documents.
Validation → Ensures data stored in DB follows rules.
Middlewares/Hooks → Code that runs before/after certain actions (e.g., before saving).
Query building → Provides easy methods like .find(), .findById(), .updateOne().
Relationships → Allows referencing or embedding documents.
