SQL VS NoSQL




//SQL (Relational Databases)

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server

Data Model: Table-based (rows & columns)

Schema: Fixed and predefined (rigid structure)

Scalability: Vertical (increase CPU, RAM of single server)

Best for: Structured data, complex queries, transactions 
(e.g., banking, ERP systems)

Query Language: Uses SQL (Structured Query Language)

Relationships: Strong support with foreign keys and joins




//NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases)

Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, DynamoDB

Data Model: Document-based, key-value, graph, or wide-column

Schema: Dynamic, flexible (can store different structures in same collection)

Scalability: Horizontal (distribute data across multiple servers easily)

Best for: Unstructured / semi-structured data, fast scaling, big data apps,
 real-time apps (e.g., social media, IoT, analytics)

Query Language: No standard language, depends on DB 
(MongoDB uses methods like .find())

Relationships: Limited (joins not as strong as SQL, 
but some support embedding or referencing)




//In one line:

SQL = structured, stable, great for transactions.
NoSQL = flexible, scalable, great for unstructured or fast-changing data.
