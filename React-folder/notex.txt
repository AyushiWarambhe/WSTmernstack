// React Summary

React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs) where the UI updates dynamically without reloading the page.

//Key Features

1. Component-Based Architecture
   The UI is divided into reusable pieces called components (for example: buttons, forms, cards).

2. Virtual DOM
   React uses a lightweight copy of the DOM to update only changed elements, making it fast and efficient.

3. Declarative Syntax
   You describe what you want the UI to look like, and React takes care of how to render it.

4. JSX (JavaScript XML)
   Combines JavaScript and HTML-like syntax, making UI code easy to write and read.

5. Unidirectional Data Flow
   Data flows in one direction (from parent to child), making apps predictable and easy to debug.

6. Hooks
   Functions like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc., allow you to manage state and side effects in functional components.

// Core Concepts

Components – Building blocks of UI
Props – Used to pass data between components
State – Manages dynamic data within a component
Lifecycle Methods / Hooks – Handle side effects and data fetching
Conditional Rendering** – Displays UI elements based on conditions

// Advantages

Fast rendering using Virtual DOM
Reusable components improve productivity
Easy to learn and maintain
Large community support
Works well with other frameworks and tools

// Common Tools and Ecosystem
