In React, Context


It is a feature that allows data to be shared across multiple components 
without the need to pass props manually through every
level of the component tree. It provides a way to make certain values 
such as user information, themes, or language preferences globally 
available throughout the application. Normally, data is passed from 
parent to child using props, but this becomes inefficient when many
components require access to the same data, leading to a problem
known as prop drilling. The React Context API solves this issue by 
allowing global data management through 
    
    three main parts: `React.createContext()` 
    to create a context, `Context.Provider`
    to supply the data, and `useContext()`
      or
    `Context.Consumer`
    to access it in child components.
        
        
This helps in cleaner and more maintainable code by eliminating
unnecessary prop passing. However, overusing context can make 
debugging and performance optimization difficult.
Therefore, it is best suited for sharing data that needs 
to be accessed by many components,
such as authentication details, themes, or application settings.
